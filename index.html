        This is the ONLY html file in the whole site.
        It's intentionally almost empty.

        Instead of having separate html pages (like starters.html, combos.html),
        JavaScript will build and swap out the content inside #app dynamically.
        This is called a "Single Page Application" (SPA).
    -->

    <div id="app">
        <!-- JavaScript will inject all page content here -->
    </div>

    <!--
        We load app.js as a "module" so that import/export works between our JS files.
        type="module" also means this script loads AFTER the HTML above is ready,
        so JavaScript can safely find #app without any timing issues.
    -->
    <script type="module" src="js/app.js"></script>
